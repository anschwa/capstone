* Description
This is the entry point to my Earlham College CS Capstone project.

The aim of my research was to investigate the performance of
innovative load balancing algorithms. This repository contains
information for running my simulations along with all the source code.

* Dependencies
- bash
- gnuplot
- Go ([[https://golang.org/]])
- Nginx (see [[file:src/nginx/readme.org][my Nginx readme]])
- Optional: IPython or Jupyter

* Running the Simulation
Executing the =setup.sh= script will setup and run a load balancing
simulation using Go, Nginx, Apache Bench, and Gnuplot. All you need to
provide is the number of webservers to launch, total requests to
benchmark, and number of concurrent requests allowed. You can also
specify the directory the plot will be generated in (default is =simulations/plots/=).
#+BEGIN_SRC text
./setup.sh <servers: 1..8> <requests> <concurrent> [plot directory]
#+END_SRC

There is a detailed log file generated in =simulations/logs/= after
each execution of =setup.sh=. If all goes well, the script will
generate a new graph in =simulations/plots/= with the simulation
results.

For the best performance, you should recompile Nginx with debugging
turned off (see [[file:src/nginx/readme.org][my Nginx readme]]).

** Running multiple simulations
The =run_sims.sh= script provides an example for executing as many
simulations as one would like. It may run for a while, so consider
using =nohup=.
#+BEGIN_SRC text
nohup ./run_sims.sh &
tail -f nohup.out
#+END_SRC

** Troubleshooting
If something goes wrong when running the simulation or any other
script, make sure that the Nginx and all websevers are no longer
running.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
# check if process is running
ps aux | grep [n]ginx
ps aux | grep "./app -name"

# kill processes
nginx -s stop
pkill -f "./app -name"  # be careful with using pkill -f
#+END_SRC
