* Description
This is the entry point to my Earlham College CS Capstone project.

The aim of my research was to investigate the performance of
innovative load balancing algorithms. This repository contains
information for running my simulations along with all the source code.

* Running the Simulation
Executing the =setup.sh= script will setup and run a load balancing
simulation using Go, Nginx, Apache Bench, and Gnuplot. All you need to
provide is the number of webservers to launch, total requests to
benchmark, and number of concurrent requests allowed.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
./setup.sh <servers: 1..8> <requests> <concurrent>
#+END_SRC

There is a detailed log file generated in =simulations/logs/= after
each execution of =setup.sh=. If all goes well, the script will
generate a new graph in =simulations/plots/= with the simulation
results.

** Troubleshooting 
If something goes wrong when running the simulation or any other
script, make sure that the Nginx and all websevers are no longer
running.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
# check if process is running
ps aux | grep [n]ginx
ps aux | grep "./app -name"

# kill processes 
nginx -s stop
pkill -f "./app -name"  # be careful with using pkill -f
#+END_SRC
