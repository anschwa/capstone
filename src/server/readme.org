* Description
This is a very simple web application written in [[https://golang.org/][Go]]. It has one job,
to simulate the unpredictability of requests to a production
webserver. To accomplish this, a Poisson pseudo-random number is
generated for each incomming request and used to determine how long
the server should sleep before sending a response.

* Using app.go
Compile and run:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
go build app.go
./app
#+END_SRC

It's easy to launch many instances of the server on the same machine.
#+BEGIN_SRC text
./app --name=<server name> --lambda=<Poisson lambda> --addr=<IP address> --port=<port> &
./app -h for help
#+END_SRC
