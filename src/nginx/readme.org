* Setup
The first thing you need to do is download the latest [[https://nginx.org/en/download.html][Nginx source]] into this directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
tar vxzf nginx-1.13.6.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

Then modify =compile_and_load_modules.sh= and
=add_modules_to_nginx.sh= so that the paths to the Nginx source and
this directory are correct for your machine.

Next, configure and install Nginx to use the two-choices and random modules:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
./add_modules_to_nginx.sh
#+END_SRC

By default, I set Nginx to compile with debugging enabled for
development. However, it is recommended to turn debugging off before
running the simulation.
#+BEGIN_SRC text
./add_modules_to_nginx.sh off
#+END_SRC

Finally, if any changes are made to the modules, you can recompile with:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
./compile_and_load_modules.sh
#+END_SRC

* Useful Commands
Sometimes, you will need to interact with Nginx directly from the
command line. These are some good things to known:

- start Nginx: =nginx=
- stop Nginx: =nginx -s stop=
- reload =nginx.conf=: =nginx -s reload=
- force quit Nginx: =pkill -f nginx=
