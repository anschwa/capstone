\begin{abstract}
Load balancing remains an important area of study in computer science
largely due to the increasing demand on data centers and webservers.
However, it is rare to see improvements in load balancing algorithms
implemented outside of expensive specialized hardware. This research
project is an attempt to bring these innovative techniques to NGINX,
the industry leading open source load balancer and webserver.

In addition to implementing a new, native NGINX module, I have
developed a simple workflow to benchmark and compare the performance
of available load balancing algorithms in any given production
environment. My benchmarks indicate that it is possible to take
advantage of more sophisticated load distribution techniques without
paying a significant performance cost in additional overhead.
